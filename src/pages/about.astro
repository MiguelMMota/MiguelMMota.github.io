    <p>
      My name is Miguel. I'm a Computer Science graduate, and I've lived and worked in various
      countries in Western Europe over the last decade. I like to take on various projects to
      explore programming languages and frameworks. Some of my past projects ranged from topics
      such as data science, fintech, audio/video processing, and game development. In recent
      years, my main focus has been on Python-based projects, and it's been quite a ride so far!
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside software development, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing board games,
      watching TV shows, and reading a good book.
