### Ethernaut CTFs

CTFs (capture-the-flag) are security-focused exercises that give aspiring security researchers and whitehats hands-on experience on a variety of vulnerability types. They usually work by providing a vulnerable smart contract and inviting the student to act as the malicious user, with a specific goal in mind: becoming the contract admin, draining/locking funds, manipulating storage in some nefarious way, etc.

Not only is this an extremely valuable exercise, it's also **so much fun!**

I started out with the OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut CTFs](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/). I documented my thoughts and solutions [here](https://github.com/MiguelMMota/web3-ctf/tree/main/ethernaut). In the future, I want do other CTFs like [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com/) and [Damn Vulnerable Defi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/).
