### Platformer
Once in a while, I like to spend some time playing with Unity. I grew up playing the likes of Sonic, Super Mario, and Rayman 2, so it's no surprise that platformers are one of my favourite video game genres.

Recently, games like Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, and Celeste have reinvigorated the genre. 

This project is strictly recreational, so progress is slow and sparse. I've programmed the physics system, which feels nice, apart from a couple of glitches. Whenever I pick up the project again, I'll focus on the procedural level generation. My ambition would be to create a new way to experience platformers, by combining my favourite elements from different games:

- Tight physics system *(Super Meat Boy)*
- Unique auto-generated levels and challenges *(Spelunky)*
- Unique ways of experiencing the game each run *(The Binding of Isaac)*
