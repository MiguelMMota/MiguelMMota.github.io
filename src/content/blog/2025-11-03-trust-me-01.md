Some years ago I collaborated with a friend to automate a couple of trading strategies. He had a strong business acumen, trading experience, and networking skills. But he didn't know a thing about software engineering - that's where I came in. We were talking about LinkedIn one day. Unlike me, he used it often for his businesses, and recommended I cultivate a profile.

*"Here, I just endorsed your Python skills."*, he said.

*"Why? You don't even know if I'm any good."*

*"It doesn't matter, nobody cares."*.

*Nobody cares*, as in, *nobody cares to check if the person endorsing your tech skills has any idea what they're talking about*. That stuck with me.

This was before personal brands became the big deal they are today. Anyone on LinkedIn nowadays knows what a pit of self and cross promotion the user experience can be. The problem is users are heavily incentivised to be grab the attention of others instead of contributing real value.

Conflicting interests underpin misrepresentations of value, and result in people and businesses optimising for *perceived* rather than *real* value:
1. Uber drivers add a bunch of useless extras to their service like treats, special fragrances, conversation, music requests. It adds 0 value, but I can understand how an Uber driver might feel almost compelled to optimise in this direction to get good reviews.
2. Restaurants are terrified of bad Yelp reviews, so they bend over backwards to appease troublesome customers. Some mean-spirited clients even hold reviews for ransom.
3. The job search industry as a whole is grossly ineffective: wildly exaggerated, AI-optimised claims from applicants, wasteful interview exercises, extremely broad requirements, large volumes of applications which get AI-filtered, and so on.
4. Social media platforms are filled with promotion of personal brands, and the majority of it revolves around false/wrong claims or fluff. Optimising for popularity or influence necessitates engaging often and quickly, which is antithetical to deep thinking and a productive exchange of ideas.

The issue is the misalignment of incentives
1. **platforms** (Uber, Yelp, LinkedIn, X) want to maximise profits, through things like user engagement and ad revenue
2. **participants** (Uber drivers, restaurants, job advertisers, social media brands) want to maximise their reach, so they optimise for *perceived* value
3. **consumers** (Uber passengers, customers, job applicants, social media users) want a *real* quality experience.

## Ray Dalio's believability system

> “The most believable opinions are those of people who 1) have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question, and 2) have demonstrated that they can logically explain the cause-effect relationships behind their conclusions. When believability weighting is done correctly and consistently, it is the fairest and the most effective decision-making system. It not only produces the best outcomes but also preserves alignment, since even people who disagree with the decision will be able to get behind it.”
> Ray Dalio

What if we could narrow the gap between real value and perceived value? Ray Dalio uses a believability-weighted decision making system, which relies on clear, public assessments of how good people are at particular tasks. In his book "Principles: Life and Work", he shares how he implemented this system at Bridgewater Associates, the large American investment management firm he started in 1975. You can find all about it here:

The gist of it is:
1. Everyone in the company has a believability score on a set of skills or traits
2. The believability score is influenced by feedback from others on their performance.
3. When faced with a decision, a group comes together to debate the topic, and then take a vote
4. Votes are weighted based on each person's believability weight on the topic

So if you're really good at something, and others recognise that you're good at it, you'll have a stronger influence in the matter. If you're not as good at something, you may still contribute to the discussion, but don't expect your vote to be as strong.

### The baseball card
Ray Dalio used another neat idea in the day-to-day company operations: your believability scores in key areas where compiled in a simple card. He called it a baseball card. Europeans like myself might be better served thinking of the Fifa player cards, like this one below:


<img src="/2025-11-03-trust-me-01/ronaldo_fifa.png" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo's Fifa card" style="width: 30%; max-width: 300px;">

What a neat (and slightly uncomfortable) approach! Ray Dalio argued in favour of honesty in dealing with everyone at his company, so he used these stat cards to provide honest assessments, an agreed upon reward structure, and keeping in mind people's strengths and weaknesses when handing assignments.

## Where does my idea come in?
A few years ago, I was considering applying to different jobs. My wife was helping me find advertisements that fit my skillset, but it was strenuous for her to do this. Job listings often include a barrage of tech terms, and wide tech stack requirements, and the job listing websites often have poor search engines. She would use search terms such as "Python Backend Engineer" and receive a list of jobs that had nothing to do with Python or Backend. 

Wouldn't it be better to go to such a website and say: "Give me all the job listings that require a Python expertise of at least 50% and at most 80%, and don't require skills in any other language above 20%?" Or even better, "here's my tech baseball card, what job listings do you have with an 80%+ fit with my profile?"

That's where this idea comes in. A reliable, decentralised, feedback system to determine believability scores! Here are some key characteristics:
1. **transparent, decentralised, autonomous** - the staple of a blockchain-based philosophy
2. scoring based on a mix of **longevity**, **feedback** and **performance** - everyone can assess your performance on any topic, but quantifiable performance, when viable, is weighed heavily. E.g.: prediction market participation can be easily quantified. New accounts start with low weight, which grows with feedback and good participation
3. **bad behaviour is penalised** - inaccurate reviews are result in a low "trustworthy" score, which affects a user's whole score and diminishes the weight of their reviews. E.g.: if a user gives bad reviews to a series of other users of good reputation, they are likely to be penalised.

> Yeap, I'm aware a project of this scope would require massive buyin from users to fully deliver on its promise. A feedback system used by a few isn't nearly as impactful as the utopic land where such a tool is ubiquitous. But this project is super fun, and a good challenge! :)

There are a lot of aspects to take into account with this project. With a wide range of possible applications, there's also a potential for a huge scope. In the next devlog, I'll go over some of these applications, the minimum feature set, and the overall system design. I expect to deepen my web3 knowledge and blockchain development skills, as well as some frontend. My plan is to document the development of this project here, from inception to MVP, at least.

Stay tuned!
