Welcome to The Python Way! 

## What is The Python Way?
This is my little sandbox where I explore new topics and projects. Expect to see this type of content in this space:

- Reflections on software architecture/design practices
- Updates on my long-term projects.
- Short experiments: a small project here, a new python package there
- Little nuggets of wisdom: a talk I liked or a useful thing I learned

Full disclaimer: I may occasionally indulge in projects in languages other than Python, to keep things fresh 😀

## When is The Python Way?
My goal is to write a new substantial blog post every other week, with some smaller updates sprinkled in between. I've got a few lined up for the near future, but this cadence may be adjusted in either direction in the future.

## Why is The Python Way?
Why a blog? To be honest, the last time I wrote a blog I was still in highschool (and it was a much different topic and writing style). Over the last few years I've learned a lot from the software engineering community, particularly the Python community. The urge to give back made me want to start writing again. But I'm also looking forward to:

- easing the growing pains for others 
- sharing some of my work 
- holding myself accountable to it
- engaging more actively with others in this space.

As to the name, '*The Python Way*'. Ah, coming up with a name *(sigh)* ... it can be frustrating at times, for sure, but this one just kinda came to me right about... 15 minutes ago, and I still think it's pretty good, so it stays. But honestly, here's why I think it's a nice fit:

- an allusion to the Holy Grail of writing code in a Pythonic way - you bet I'll be writing on this in the future
- "The Way of Python" is the original thread under which [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) was originally posted (more on this later)
- a reference to the Disney+ show *The Mandalorian*, which I quite enjoy
- also a little nod to  [Raymond Hettinger](https://twitter.com/raymondh)'s catchphrase. Some of his [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) are a must watch

## requirements.txt
There are plenty of excellent resources for someone who wishes to start learning Python. If you're a beginner, I recommend you check out [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex)'s courses and [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5)'s youtube channel which are both fantastic. With that said, I don't think there's much value I could provide to beginners that isn't covered extensively already. 

In this blog, I'll assume you're at least an intermediate Python developer. That means:

- You've **mastered the basics**: basic data types, operators, conditionals, loops, I/O, installing/importing packages, setting up your environment
- You're **comfortable with some intermediate level stuff**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance, basic threading/multiprocessing, logging, and so on.

Don't be alarmed if you don't know all of these things, you'll be still be able to follow along even if you're missing a couple of these tools in your kit, and I'll try to be as beginner-friendly as possible. 😀


So this is it! Feel free to message me with any questions, comments, or suggestions!
